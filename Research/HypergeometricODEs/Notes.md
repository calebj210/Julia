# Notes on the Taylor Method for ${_2}F_1$
## TODOs
- [ ] Remove tail errors.
- [ ] Improve branch cut graphics.
    - [ ] Pin down branch cuts.
    - [ ] Seamlessly stitch sheets.

## Questions
- Are there any common trends in the lower accuracy tests (not just failed tests)?
- Are straight stepping paths more than enough?
- Does the Wronskian indicate a preferred direction of travel?
- Can we remove the 1-2 digits of accuracy loss present in the transformed initializations?
