# Hypergeometric Project Notes
## General Notes
- Using the Taylor method on $e^{-a z}$ where $a = 1000$ leads to very similar issues with convergence that we see for $\,_2F_1$ for all negative parameters.
    - However, decreasing the step size does allow for convergence but not necessarily to full precision.
    - Do we really not see the same convergence patterns for $\,_2F_1$?
