# High Order FD notes
## 2D Grid
### TODOs
- [ ] Go to higher order in 2D scaled weight system.
- [ ] Verify Bengt's table pattern in when the orders jump.

## 3D Grid
### TODOs
- [ ] Look at linearly independent weight systems.
- [ ] Look at scaled least squares system and corresponding decay rates.

## Scattered Nodes
### Questions
- [ ] Are RBFs necessary?
- [ ] Is there a better formulation like the 2D weighted system

### TODOs
- [ ] Implement scattered harmonic FD weights
